# SmallScheme

- This is a minimalistic implementation of the Scheme programming language.
- At the moment, there is support for variable bindings, basic arithmetic, procedures, a simplified file and IO system, lists and list primitives, symbols, boolean logic, and the  calling of external commands. As a user, you have the option of an REPL or an interpreter.

- What I would like to add support for includes the following: recursion, the trio of map, reduce, and filter, type casting, the passing of symbols as inputs to procedures, and better support for strings.

- Update: I have added the following functionality: loading files into an REPL, map, filter, complete string support, and recursion!
- To do: symbols as input to procedures, reduce, and type casting.
